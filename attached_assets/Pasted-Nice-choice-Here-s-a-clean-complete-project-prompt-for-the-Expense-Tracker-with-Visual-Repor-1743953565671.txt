## 💡 Prompt: Build an Expense Tracker with Visual Reports

### 💸 **Project Idea: Expense Tracker with Visual Insights**

I'm working on a **web-based Expense Tracker** that allows users to log their daily spending and receive meaningful **visual insights**, trends, and saving tips. It’s aimed at students and young professionals learning personal finance.

---

### 🚀 **Core Features (Must-Have):**

1. **User Authentication**
   - Use **Google Firebase Authentication** (email/password, Google sign-in).
   - Each user has their own secure dashboard and expense data.

2. **Expense Logging**
   - Form to enter daily expenses: amount, category, date, description.
   - Categories include: Food, Transport, Bills, Education, Misc.
   - Allow editing and deleting entries.

3. **Visual Reports & Analytics**
   - Generate charts using **matplotlib** or **Plotly**:
     - Pie chart: spending by category
     - Line/bar chart: daily/weekly/monthly trends
   - Calculate total spent, average spending, and highest expense.

4. **Smart Tips & Summaries**
   - Display saving tips based on spending behavior (e.g., “You're spending a lot on dining out”).
   - Show weekly or monthly summaries.

5. **Dashboard UI**
   - Clean, mobile-friendly interface with:
     - "Add Expense" form
     - Visual charts
     - Daily/Monthly breakdown
     - Tip cards and stats

6. **Export / Download**
   - Option to export expense data to `.csv` or `.pdf`.

### 🎯 **Why This Is Helpful:**

Most students don’t have an easy way to track their expenses visually or understand their spending habits. This app helps build budgeting awareness, visualize financial patterns, and build better money habits over time.

### 🧠 Optional Stretch Features:

- Budget limit alerts (e.g., notify user if they exceed $100 in Food this week).
- Add recurring expenses (subscriptions).
- Set savings goals.
- Dark mode toggle 🌙
